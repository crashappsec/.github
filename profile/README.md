## Hello World, we are Crash Override  ðŸ‘‹

We are new applcation security company founded in June 2022 by [Mark Curphey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/curphey/) and [John Viega](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viega/).  While the company is new, we were right there at the start of the application security movement 20 years ago, authoring the first ever book on the topic, [Building Secure Software](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Secure-Software-Addison-wesley-Professional/dp/0321774957) and founding [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org), the Open Web Application Security Project. Recently we have been founders of two application security companies, [SourceClear](https://fortune.com/2018/04/09/buy-ca-technologies-veracode-sourceclear/) and [Capsule8](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud/sophos-acquires-capsule8-for-linux-server-container-security).

We are on a mission to help application security teams **reduce their workload** and **focus on what matters** and are building a platform alongside a set of design partners who operate application security programs at some of the world's top companies. If you want to help shape the future of our product then we would love to hear from you. 

So why the name Crash Override ? At heart we are hackers. We  explore how things work, use computers to overcome technical problems, donâ€™t worry about conventions and want to make the world a better place. Our brand is a nod to the cult classic security movie, [Hackers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/), where Crash Override was the handle of the main character, Dade Murphy. 

We are literally a security company named after a film that celebrated the hacker manifesto and the inclusivity of outliers.
