## Hello World, we are Crash Override  ðŸ‘‹

We are new applcation security company founded in June 2022 by [Mark Curphey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/curphey/) and [John Viega](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viega/).  While the company is new, we were right there at the start of the application security movement 20 years ago, authoring the first ever book on the topic, [Building Secure Software](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Secure-Software-Addison-wesley-Professional/dp/0321774957) and founding [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org), the Open Web Application Security Project. Recently we have been founders of two application security companies, [SourceClear](https://fortune.com/2018/04/09/buy-ca-technologies-veracode-sourceclear/) and [Capsule8](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud/sophos-acquires-capsule8-for-linux-server-container-security).

We are on a mission to help application security teams **reduce their workload** and **focus on what matters**.

### The world has changed

DevOps has changed the way we build and deploy software, and the cloud has changed the way we operationalize it. Itâ€™s a new world order. But thereâ€™s a snag in the revolution.....security teams are drowning in noise.

### Security teams are drowning in noise

You know the drill. Everytime a new CVE hits the wire, alerts come into the SOC, and vulnerabilities flood in from automated scanning tools. Your team scrambles for a solution. Spray and pray? Itâ€™s slow. Itâ€™s expensive. And it doesnâ€™t work. You need something smarter.

### Screw appsec busy work

Imagine instead of running around with your hair on fire, hiring an army of application security engineers and worrying about a spiraling budget - instead your team is totally Zen. Youâ€™re calm and confident. Working on the right things, for the right reasons. Itâ€™s appsec nirvana.

### The key?

We believe the key to this Zen mindset lies in being able to focus on what matters. No more drowning in CVE alerts, SAST and SCA findings, pen test reports, Jira tickets, etc. To transcend to appsec greatness, you need to silence the noise and focus.

### Enter Crash Override

So turning noise into signal is what we do. We provide you with a clear, prioritized list of what to focus on now, next, or never, along with proper evidence and context to support those recommendations. Whatâ€™s more - you can interactively query anything, anytime.

We are building the platform alongside a set of design partners who operate application security programs at some of the world's top companies. If you share our vision and want to help shape the future of our product then we would love to hear from you. 

So why the name Crash Override ? At heart we are hackers. We  explore how things work, use computers to overcome technical problems, donâ€™t worry about conventions and want to make the world a better place. Our brand is a nod to the cult classic security movie, [Hackers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/), where Crash Override was the handle of the main character, Dade Murphy. 

We are literally a security company named after a film that celebrated the hacker manifesto and the inclusivity of outliers.
